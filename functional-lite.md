Notes from [Functional lite js](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-js-lite/#v=mpx9vosfmi)

### Side effects
- Identify stateful variables
- Identify mutated variables
- Identify required input and output
- Wrap mutating operations in a closure and pass in the required universe
- Perform required operation(s)
- Encapsulate and return observed end state
- From the outside, now the operation is pure (can call with same input and get same output)
