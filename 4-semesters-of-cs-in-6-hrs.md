### Big O
- Big picture of an algorithm
- Ignore little things and focus on big picture
- Typically focuses on time
- Also can consider spatial analysis (memory req)
- O(n): go through everything once, or some nested for loops
- O(n^2): loop within a loop
- O(1): no loops, just return something (constant time)
- O(log n): divide an conquer strategy (recursion), time diminishes per input as input grows

### Sorting
- Bubble sort: useful to understand sorting, but very slow O(n^2)
  - Loop over the list until there are no more variables to swap
- Insertion sort: useful for arrays that are already close to being sorted
