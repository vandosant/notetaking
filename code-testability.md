### Notes From Frontend Masters [Code Testability](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/angularjs-and-code-testability/)


### Why
- Running the test is faster than running the app
- Writing test code is hard, writing the code it tests is hard
- Instant feedback

### How
- What the code does is irrelevant
- How the code is stuctured is what makes it testable
- Ask for fundamentally required items in the constructor
- Separate out business logic

### Stages
1. Integration / Scenario
2. Functional
3. Unit
